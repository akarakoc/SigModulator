# SigModulator
Digital Signal Processing via various types of modulations, demodulations and CD/DC conversions

In this project, it is required to design two separated modules which generate and receive signal separately. In order to achieve this, a wire is connected to both microphone and speaker socket of the computer. By that way discrete to continuous and continuous to discrete operation can be done. The generated signal is digital and in order to give this to the real world it is converted to continuous time by some processes. In this project, we will test the generated and received signals, compare them each others in terms of time domain, Fourier domain and cross correlation. We will also investigate the aliasing sampling and quantizing with respect to each other.
