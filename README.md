# SigModulator
Digital Signal Processing via various types of modulations, demodulations and CD/DC conversions

There are separated modules which generate and receive signal separately. In order to achieve this, a wire is connected to both microphone and speaker socket of the computer. By that way discrete to continuous and continuous to discrete operation is done. The generated signal is digital and converted to continuous time by some processes. In this project, we are testing the generated and received signals, compare them with respect to each others in terms of time domain, Fourier domain and cross correlation. We will also investigate the aliasing sampling and quantizing with respect to each other.
